Definition and Overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
=====================================================================

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as perception, reasoning, learning, decision-making, and natural language processing. AI has been around for several decades, but recent advances in machine learning and deep learning have propelled its growth and impact on society.

The field of AI is broad and encompasses many subfields, including natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, expert systems, and machine learning. These subfields work together to develop intelligent systems that can learn from data, reason about complex problems, and interact with humans in a natural way.

One of the most significant applications of AI is in augmented reality (AR). AR combines the real world with digital information, creating an interactive and immersive user experience. AR systems that incorporate AI can recognize objects, understand context, and provide personalized recommendations based on user behavior.

There are several challenges to the development and implementation of AI in AR systems, such as data privacy, ethical considerations, and technical limitations. However, the potential benefits of combining these two technologies are immense, from enhancing training simulations to improving shopping experiences.

In this chapter, we will provide an overview of AI and its subfields, as well as its applications in AR. We will also discuss the current state of AI research and the challenges that lie ahead in building intelligent AR systems that enhance the user experience.
