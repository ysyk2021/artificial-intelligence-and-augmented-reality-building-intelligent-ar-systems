Augmented reality (AR) is a technology that overlays digital information and virtual elements on top of the real-world environment in real-time. It allows users to enhance their perception of reality by providing additional context, information, and interactivity through a variety of devices such as smartphones, tablets, smart glasses, and head-mounted displays.

AR combines computer-generated graphics, audio, and other sensory inputs with the user's physical environment, creating a seamless and interactive experience that blurs the line between the digital and physical worlds. This technology has been used in various fields such as entertainment, education, healthcare, and retail, among others.

In recent years, the development of AI has significantly improved the capabilities of AR systems. AI algorithms can analyze the user's environment and provide relevant information or suggestions based on the user's context and preferences, making AR experiences more personalized and intuitive.

This book, "Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Reality: Building Intelligent AR Systems That Enhance the User Experience", aims to explore the intersection between AI and AR and how these two technologies can work together to create more intelligent and immersive AR experiences. Throughout this book, we will examine various applications of AI and AR, discuss the challenges of building intelligent AR systems, and provide practical insights into developing AR applications that enhance the user experience.

Overall, this book is intended for anyone interested in learning about the latest advancements in AR and AI and how they can be integrated to create innovative and engaging user experiences that bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds.
