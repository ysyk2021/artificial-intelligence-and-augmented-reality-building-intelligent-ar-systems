Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Augmented Reality (AR) are two rapidly evolving technologies that have the potential to revolutionize many industries. Both technologies have their own unique benefits, but when combined, they can create a truly immersive and intelligent user experience.

AI refers to the ability of machines to learn from data and make decisions based on that learning. This includes machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. AR, on the other hand, involves overlaying digital content onto the physical world, creating an enhanced experience for the user.

The intersection of AI and AR has led to the development of intelligent AR systems that can recognize and respond to their surroundings in real-time. These systems can analyze data from sensors and cameras to provide personalized and context-aware information to users. For example, an intelligent AR system could use computer vision to identify an object and then provide additional information about it to the user.

In this book, we will explore the various ways in which AI and AR can be combined to create intelligent AR systems. We will discuss the challenges and opportunities of building such systems and provide practical examples of how they can be used in different industries.

Overall, the intersection of AI and AR has the potential to transform the way we interact with the world around us. By creating intelligent AR systems, we can enhance the user experience and provide new and innovative solutions to complex problems.
