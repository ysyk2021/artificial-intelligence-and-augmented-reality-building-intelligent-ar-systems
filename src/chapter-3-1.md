History of AR
==========================================================

Introduction
------------

Augmented reality (AR) has been around for quite some time, but it wasn't until the last decade that it started gaining popularity and widespread adoption. This chapter will provide a historical overview of AR and its roots, starting from the early days of computer graphics and virtual reality.

Early Days of Computer Graphics
-------------------------------

The origins of AR can be traced back to the early days of computer graphics, which began in the 1960s. The first computer graphic system was developed by Ivan Sutherland, who created a program called Sketchpad. This program allowed users to interact with the computer using a light pen and draw images on the screen. While this system did not involve augmented reality as we know it today, it laid the groundwork for the development of computer graphics and related technologies.

Virtual Reality and the Birth of AR
-----------------------------------

Virtual reality (VR) emerged in the 1980s as a way to create immersive digital environments. The first VR systems were expensive and required specialized equipment, such as head-mounted displays and data gloves. However, these early systems paved the way for the development of AR technology. In fact, the term "augmented reality" was coined in 1992 by Tom Caudell and David Mizell, researchers at Boeing, who used the term to describe a system they designed for aircraft assembly workers.

AR in Commercial Applications
-----------------------------

AR technology became more widely available in the 2000s, with the release of smartphones and other mobile devices that could support AR applications. One of the earliest commercial AR applications was the ARToolKit, an open-source software library that allowed developers to create AR applications for a wide range of platforms. Other early AR applications included games, educational tools, and marketing campaigns.

Current State of AR
-------------------

Today, AR technology is used in a variety of applications, including gaming, education, healthcare, and retail. Some of the most popular AR applications include Snapchat filters, Pokemon Go, and IKEA's AR furniture catalog. As AR technology continues to evolve and improve, we can expect to see even more innovative and exciting applications in the future.

Conclusion
----------

AR has come a long way since its early days as a research project at Boeing. Today, it is a rapidly growing industry with a wide range of applications and potential uses. By understanding the history of AR and its evolution over time, we can better appreciate the possibilities and challenges of building intelligent AR systems that enhance the user experience.
