Summary of Key Points
=================================

In this book, we have explored the intersection of two exciting fields - Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Reality. We have seen how these two technologies can be combined to create intelligent AR systems that enhance the user experience in numerous ways.

Throughout the book, we have covered a range of topics, including:

* An introduction to AI and AR, and their potential applications
* The basics of machine learning and computer vision
* Techniques for building intelligent AR systems
* Real-world examples of successful implementations

We have also discussed some of the challenges involved in creating intelligent AR systems, such as data privacy concerns and the need for effective user interfaces.

Overall, we believe that the combination of AI and AR has enormous potential for improving the way we interact with technology and with each other. By harnessing the power of machine learning and computer vision, we can create AR systems that are more intelligent, intuitive, and responsive than ever before.

As we move forward into the future, we are excited to see what new innovations will emerge at the intersection of AI and AR, and we look forward to being a part of this exciting journey.
